TryHackMe Room Documentation – Systems as Attack Vectors

Lab Name: Systems as Attack Vectors
Link: ([https://tryhackme.com/room/systemsattackvectors](https://tryhackme.com/room/systemsattackvectors))

1. Objective / Learning Goals

> > > Understanding how systems themselves become entry points for cyber attacks
> > > Learning how SOC teams detect, monitor, and defend vulnerable systems

2. Key Concepts / Notes

> > > Systems become attack vectors when they are unpatched, misconfigured, or poorly secured

> > > Attackers actively scan for outdated software, exposed services, and known vulnerabilities to gain initial access

> > > Common system-based attack methods include exploiting unpatched operating systems, vulnerable applications, open ports, and weak configurations

> > > Poor patch management increases the attack surface and gives adversaries more opportunities to exploit known CVEs

> > > SOC analysts play a critical role by monitoring system logs, detecting suspicious activity, and responding to exploitation attempts

> > > Implementing system hardening, least privilege access, and proper configuration management reduces the risk of privilege escalation

> > > Continuous vulnerability scanning helps identify weaknesses before attackers do

3. Hands-On

> > > This lab featured a walkthrough showing how insecure systems can become entry points for attackers

> > > I learned how outdated software versions create exploitable weaknesses

> > > I reviewed how exposed services and open ports increase risk if not properly secured

> > > I explored defensive measures such as applying patches regularly, disabling unnecessary services, and enforcing strong access controls

> > > I observed how monitoring tools and alerts help SOC teams detect abnormal system behavior early

5. Takeaways

> > > Regular patching and proper configuration are essential to securing systems

> > > Reducing the attack surface limits opportunities for attackers

> > > Continuous monitoring and vulnerability management are core SOC responsibilities

> > > Securing systems is just as important as securing people in a cybersecurity strategy
